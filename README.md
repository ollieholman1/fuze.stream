# fuze.stream

fuze.stream is a next-generation, fully decentralised social video platform that is owned and governed by its content creators and users.

## Story

It is without a question that the meteoric rise of the web3 paradigm has sparked a lot of excitement due to the large amount of potential it holds. However, for it to be truly mass-adopted, projects must be made that can be used by everyone - and benefit them without the need for users to understand the technical side of things. 

At the moment, the most popular web3 powered applications revolve around assets, like NFT or DeFi related projects. While these creations are at the forefront of web3 develpoment, there seems to be a lot of repitition, and a lack of innovation and use cases.

Furthermore, due to the freshness of web3 and its reputation of being complex and risky, the average user may be discouraged from using creations powered by it. This is reinforced by the fact that there is no real world example of how it can be beneficial to a users life. 

It's safe to say that everyday people wont change the services they use unless there is a blunt example of how their life can be improved by using something else.

**Therefore, it's about time something is made that gives web3 a friendly face while offering truly beneficial features.**

## Project Outline

Broadly speaking, fuze.stream is a decentralised social video platform which encourages and rewards content creation and interaction, without undermining the hard work of its users. 

Every piece of content, from a whole video to a simple comment, will be minted as a non-fungible token on the blockchain. The content statistics *e.g, views, likes, comments etc...*  will be gathered and stored within the tokens metadata. As a result, content is transformed into assets which can be bought, sold and collected just like any other non-fungible token. 

As well as this, users will be paid in fuze tokens proportionately to the performance of their content. The more popular their content, the more tokens they receive. Fuze tokens can be sold and cashed out, or be used to gift other creators.

In a nutshell, this means:
1. Viral and popular content can be sold on the open market, rewarding users for contributing to the site. *Please note, the content creator will always remain the same no matter how many times content has been transacted.*
2. Any type of user is eligible for monitization regardless of their account size. This is opposed to YouTube where only certain channels can be monitized.
3. Users are given an incentive to create and interact with content.

## Moderation

Moderation is a vital element of any social media platform. In an era where misinformation and explicit content is at an all time high, it is cruicial that negative and illegal content must be removed.

Usually this isn't an issue as all big social media platforms have moderation teams, but what is the case for decentralised ones? How can reliable moderation be achieved without a central power?

Fuze will contain a moderation program. It allows specific users - that meet a target of followers - to enroll as a content moderator.

Content moderators are shown pieces of text that have been flagged by an explicit content detection algorithm. They are simply prompted to decide whether the given content could cause offence by either pressing 'Yes' or 'No'.

To rule out any bias or rouge moderation, the same prompt is broadcasted to a large amount of users. When a certain amount of responses are received, they are averaged and deemed overall safe or unsafe. Unsafe content gets deleted, and the creator gets flagged. If a creator is flagged a certain amount of times they will be banned.

## Conclusion

This was just a broad top level explanation of what fuze.stream is and aspires to be. As development continues a whitepaper will be created, breaking down the components of the project and explaining how they work to a detailed degree.
