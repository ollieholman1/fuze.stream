TODO List:

Design constraints:
Video title max 80 chars

Design:
-- Navigation
1) Hide the side nav bar on mobile devices and increase the video width to 100% (for fitting purposes)
2) Add the nav bar hamburger to the top of the sidebar, not the navbar
   - fixes the fixed scrolling issue where the hamburger icon stays attached to top
3) On mobile devices, show side nav on top of content instead of pushing to the side
   - prevents unwanted results when content is pushed off to the right
4) replace the search bar with a search icon on the main nav bar

-- General
1) dark mode

-- Left Video Pane
1) add collapsable description underneath views/video actions
2) custom video gui

-- Right Video Pane
1) add channel infomation at the top
   - profile pic, name, followers, subscribe, support (tip) 
2) add comments on the bottom (with ability to post comment first)

-- Recommendation
1) create placeholder cards that run underneath video panes
2) different rows for different content types
